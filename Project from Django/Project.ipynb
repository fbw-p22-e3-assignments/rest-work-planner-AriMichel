    "To build a REST application from scratch that serves as a work planning service, we'll start by creating a new Django project and then proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Set up a Django Project:\n",
    "1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",

    "3. Change into the project directory: `cd work_planning_service`.\n",
    "4. Create a new virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`.\n",
    "5. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "   - On Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`\n",
    "6. Install Django: `pip install django`.\n",
    "7. Create a new Django project: `django-admin startproject work_planning_service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Create a Django App:\n",
    "1. Change into the project directory: `cd work_planning_service`.\n",
    "2. Create a new Django app: `python manage.py startapp work_planning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Define the Models:\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning/models.py` file.\n",
    "2. Define the models for Employee and Shift:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Employee(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",

    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.employee.name}'s Shift: {self.get_start_time_display()}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Create Serializers:\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning/serializers.py` file.\n",
    "2. Define the serializers for Employee and Shift:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from rest_framework import serializers\n",
    "from .models import Employee, Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "class ShiftSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Shift\n",
    "        fields = '__all__'\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmployeeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n",
    "    shifts = ShiftSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Employee\n",
    "        fields = '__all__'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Define Views:\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning/views.py` file.\n",
    "2. Define the views using Django REST Framework's generic views:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from rest_framework import generics\n",
    "from .models import Employee, Shift\n",
    "from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer, ShiftSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class EmployeeListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):\n",
    "    queryset = Employee.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class ShiftListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):\n",
    "    queryset = Shift.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = ShiftSerializer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Configure URLs:\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning_service/urls.py` file.\n",
    "2. Configure the URL patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",
    "from work_planning.views import EmployeeListCreateView, ShiftListCreateView\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path('employees/', EmployeeListCreateView.as_view(), name='employee-list-create'),\n",
    "    path('shifts/', ShiftListCreateView.as_view(), name='shift-list-create'),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Run Migrations and Start the Server:\n",
    "1. Run database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.\n",
    "2. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a RESTful API with the following endpoints:\n",
    "- `/employees/`: List and create employees.\n",
    "- `/shifts/`: List and create shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use API testing tools like Postman or cURL"

    "Sure! Here are the steps to build a Django web application, store it on GitHub, and create a REST API for a work planning service:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Set up the Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Python 3: Python is the programming language used by Django. You can install it by running `sudo apt install python3` in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install pip: Pip is the package installer for Python. You can install it by running `sudo apt install python3-pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework used for rapid development. Install it by running `pip3 install django`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install Django REST framework: Django REST framework is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. Install it by running `pip3 install djangorestframework`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Install PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. Install it by running `sudo apt install postgresql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Create a New Django Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new directory for your project: Run `mkdir work_planning_project` to create a new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change into the project directory: Run `cd work_planning_project` to navigate into the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a new Django project: Run `django-admin startproject work_planning` to create a new Django project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change into the project directory: Run `cd work_planning` to navigate into the project directory created by the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and sign in to your account. Click on the \"New\" button to create a new repository. Provide a name for the repository, choose the appropriate options, and click on \"Create repository\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connect the local project with the remote repository: In the terminal, run `git init` to initialize a new Git repository. Then, run `git remote add origin <repository_url>` to connect the local project with the remote repository you created on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Commit and push the initial code to GitHub: Run `git add .` to stage all the changes, then run `git commit -m \"Initial commit\"` to commit the changes. Finally, run `git push origin master` to push the code to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Define Models and Serializer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning/models.py` file and define the models for Employee and Shift as per the given business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the `work_planning/serializers.py` file and create serializers for Employee and Shift models using Django REST framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Create Views and URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the `work_planning/views.py` file and define views for creating employees and shifts using Django REST framework's APIView or viewsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the `work_planning/urls.py` file and define URL patterns for the API endpoints, mapping them to the respective views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Run Migrations and Start the Server\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run database migrations: Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create migration files based on the models you defined. Then, run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the migrations and create the necessary database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start the development server: Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django development server. You can access your web application at http://localhost:8000/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Test the API with Postman\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Postman: Postman is a popular API development and testing tool. Install it by downloading the appropriate version for your operating system from the official website (https://www.postman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open Postman and create a new request.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set the request method, URL, and headers according to the API endpoint you want to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Send the request and inspect the response to verify that the API is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can repeat the above steps for different API endpoints to test different functionalities of your work planning service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to refer to the Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/) and Django REST framework documentation (https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for more detailed explanations and usage examples of various Django and Django REST framework features."
