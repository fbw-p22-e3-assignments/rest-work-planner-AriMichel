    "\n",
    "Step 10: Add Serialization, Testing, and HTML Sanitization\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization: We have already defined serializers in the serializers.py file. You can use these serializers to convert complex data objects into native Python data types, such as JSON, for rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Django provides a testing framework that allows you to write unit tests for your views, serializers, and other components of your application. You can create test cases to validate the behavior and functionality of your API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Sanitization: To sanitize HTML input, you can use the django-html-sanitizer library. Install it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "pip install django-html-sanitizer\n",
    "You can then use the library to sanitize HTML input and prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to document your code with comments and follow best practices for writing clean and maintainable code."
